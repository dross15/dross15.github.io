	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>In 2015, I graduated from Amherst College with a degree in environmental studies and very little exposure to the world of technology. Nonetheless, I ventured to Denver, CO to work as a Business Systems Analyst at MetLife. While I enjoyed learning about Met's systems and how to write technical documents, I quickly recognized what I really yearned for was the ability to change the code myself.</p>
	<p>I have always had passions for design, conceptualization, and construction, so learning to code was a natural next step. I began teaching myself basic web development through online tutorials and local classes. While I got off to a great start I began to see the value of having a formal computer science education which led me to enroll in a Computer Science Post-Bac at Tufts University. I hope to leave Tufts as a stronger contributer to the fields of IT and Technology and look forward to applying my skills in the workforce.</p>
