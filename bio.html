	<h2 class="underline">About Me</h2>
	<p>In 2015, I graduated from Amherst College with a degree in environmental studies and very little exposure to the world of technology. Nonetheless, I ventured to Denver, CO to work as a Business Systems Analyst at MetLife. While I enjoyed learning about Met's systems and how to write technical documents, I quickly recognized what I really yearned for was the ability to code.</p>
	<p>I have always had passions for design, conceptualization, and construction, so learning to code was a natural next step. I began teaching myself basic web development through online tutorials and local classes. While I got off to a great start I began to see the value of having a formal computer science education so I enrolled in Tufts University's Computer Science Post-Bac Program. I hope to leave Tufts as a stronger contributer to the fields of IT and Technology, and look forward to applying my skills in the workforce.</p>
